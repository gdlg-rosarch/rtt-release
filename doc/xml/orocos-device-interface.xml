    <section>
      <title>The Orocos Device Interface (<acronym>DI</acronym>)</title>
      <para>
	Designing portable software which should interact with
	hardware is very hard. Some efforts, like <ulink
	  url="http://www.comedi.org"> Comedi</ulink>
	propose a generic interface to communicate with a certain kind
	of hardware (mainly analog/digital IO). This allows us to
	change hardware and still use the same code to communicate
	with it.  Therefore, we aim at supporting every Comedi
	supported card.  We invite you to help us writing a C++
	wrapper for this API and port comedilib (which adds more
	functionality) to the real-time kernels.
      </para>
      <para>
	We do not want to force people into using Comedi, and most of
	us have home written device drivers.  To allow total
	implementation independence, we are writing C++ device
	interfaces 
	which just defines which functionalities a generic device
	driver should implement. It is up to the developers to wrap
	their C device driver into a class which implements this
	interface. You can find an example of this in the devices
	package.  This package only contains the interface header files.
	Other packages should always point to these interface files
	and never to the real drivers actually used.  It is up to the
	application writer to decide which driver will actually be
	used.
      </para>
      <section><title>Structure</title>
      <para>
	The Device Interface can be structured
	in two major parts : <emphasis>physical</emphasis> device
	interfaces and <emphasis>logical</emphasis> device interfaces.
	Physical device interfaces can be subdivided in four basic
	interfaces: <classname>RTT::AnalogInput</classname>, <classname>RTT::AnalogOutput</classname>, 
	<classname>RTT::DigitalInput</classname>,
	<classname>RTT::DigitalOutput</classname>. Analog devices
	are addressed with a channel as parameter and write a ranged
	value, while digital devices are addressed with a bit number
	as parameter and a true/false value.
      </para>
      <para>Logical device interfaces
	represent the entities humans like to work with: a drive, a
	sensor, an encoder, etc. They put <emphasis>semantics</emphasis> on top
	of the physical interfaces they use underneath. You just want to know the
	position of a positional encoder in radians for example.
	Often, the physical layer is device dependent (and thus
	non-portable) while the logical layer is device independent.

	</figure>
      </para></section>
      <section><title>Example</title>
      <para>An example of the
	interactions between the logical and the physical layer is the
	logical encoder with its physical counting card. An encoder is
	a physical device keeping track of the position of an axis of
	a robot or machine. The programmer wishes to use the encoder
	as a sensor and just asks for the current position. Thus a
	logical encoder might choose to implement the
	<classname>RTT::SensorInterface</classname> which provides
	a <methodname>read(DataType &amp; )</methodname> function.
	Upon construction of the logical sensor, we supply the real
	device driver as a parameter. This device driver implements
	for example <classname>RTT::AnalogInInterface</classname>
	which provides <methodname>read(DataType &amp; data, unsigned
	  int chan)</methodname> and allows to read the position of a
	certain encoder of that particular card.

      <title>The Device Interface Classes</title>
      <para>
	The most common used interfaces for machine control
	are already implemented and tested on multiple setups.
	All the Device Interface classes reside in the
	<classname>RTT</classname> namespace.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Physical IO</title>
	<para>
	  There are several classes for representing
	  different kinds of IO. Currently there are:

	<title>Logical Device Interfaces</title>
	<para>
	  From a logical point of view, the generic
	  <classname>RTT::SensorInterface</classname>&lt;T> is an
	  easy to use abstraction for reading any kind 
	  of data of type T.
	</para>
	<para>
	  You need to look in the Orocos Component Library
	  for implementations of the Device Interface.
	  Examples are <classname>Axis</classname> and
	  <classname>AnalogDrive</classname>.

      <title>Porting Device Drivers to Device Interfaces</title>
      <para>
	The methods in each interface are well documented
	and porting existing drivers (which mostly have a C API)
	to these should be quite straight forward. It is the
	intention that the developer writes a class that
	inherits from one or more interfaces and implements
	the corresponding methods. Logical Devices can then
	use these implementations to provide higher level
	functionalities.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Interface Name Serving</title>
      <para>
	Name Serving is introduced in the Orocos CoreLib documentation.
      </para>
      <para>
	The Device Interface provides name serving on interface level. This means
	that one can ask a certain interface by which objects it is
	implemented and retrieve the desired instance. No type-casting
	whatsoever is needed for this operation. For now, only the
	physical device layer can be queried for entities, since
	logical device drivers are typically instantiated where
	needed, given an earlier loaded physical device driver.
      </para>
      <para>
	<xref linkend="example_name_service"/> shows how one could query the 
	<classname>RTT::DigitalOutInterface</classname>.
	  
	<example id="example_name_service"><title>Using the name service</title>
	    
	  <programlisting>  FancyCard* fc = new FancyCard("CardName"); // FancyCard implements DigitalOutInterface

  // Elsewhere in your program:
  bool value = true;
  <classname>RTT::DigitalOutInterface</classname>* card = DigitalOutInterface::nameserver.getObject("CardName");
  if (card)
      card->setBit(0, value);    // Set output bit to 'true'. </programlisting>
