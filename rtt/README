The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit
============================

Quick Installation
==================

The Orocos RTT requires the 'cmake' program to be present, version
2.6.2 or later is required. http://www.cmake.org

Download the latest version from http://www.orocos.org/rtt

	tar -xvjf orocos-rtt-<version>-src.tar.bz2
	cd orocos-rtt-<version>
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	make check
	make install

The installation manual can be found in the doc dir.  You can also
consult it online on the http://www.orocos.org website.


Configuring Orocos RTT
======================

Instead of 'cmake ..', issue 'ccmake ..' from your build
directory.  The keys to use are 'arrows'/'enter' to modify a setting,
'c' to run a configuration check (may be required multiple times), 'g'
to generate the makefiles. If an additional configuration check is
required, the 'g' key can not be used and you must press 'c' and
examine the output.

CORBA
=====
Corba is not enabled by default. If you have ACE/TAO or Omniorb installed, use

  cmake .. -DENABLE_CORBA=ON -DCORBA_IMPLEMENTATION=TAO
or
  cmake .. -DENABLE_CORBA=ON -DCORBA_IMPLEMENTATION=OMNIORB
