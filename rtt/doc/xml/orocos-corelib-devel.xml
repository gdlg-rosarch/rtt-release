    <title>PeriodicActivity</title>
    <para>
      The RTT::PeriodicActivity is an activity that serialises itself
      in a common thread, such that multiple activities are executed
      by the same thread.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Periodic Activity Ordering</title>
      <para>
	In case multiple activities are executed (serialised) in one
	thread, their execution must be ordered. The order of execution is
	determined by the order in which they are started. Stopping
	an activity removes it from the list.

	A PeriodicActivity instance is only serialised with another instance

      <warning>
	<para>
	  If other threads are running in the same program executable,
	  they will also 'notice' the fast system time changes if the SimulationThread
	  is started. It is thus advisable not to mix SimulationThreads with
	  other threads. Also, any thread with lower priority than the 
	  SimulationThread will never run.

    <section id="core-priority-inversions">
      <title>Priority Inversions</title>
      <para>
	A Priority inversion is the term used to indicate a scheduling situation
	in which a high priority thread is blocked on a resource which is held
	by a low priority thread, while a medium priority thread is running,
	preventing the low priority thread to free the resource for the high
	priority thread. 
      </para>
      <para>
	The result is an inverted priority because a medium priority thread
	is running while the high priority thread should be runnen, hence, 
	the medium priority thread has, in practice, a higher priority than
	the high priority thread.
      </para>
      <para>
	There are roughly said two solution to this problem. 1. Do 
	not block on resources from high priority threads. 2. Use priority
	inheritance, where a thread gets the priority of the highest priority
	thread being blocked on a resource it holds. Once it releases the
	resource, its priority goes back to normal and the high priority thread
	can resume.
      </para>
      <para>
	In essence, Orocos does not know of priority inversions and does not
	know if the underlying Operating System properly solves this common
	situation. Furthermore, it can be prooven that there are situations 
	where priority inheritance does not work.
	Therefore, we try to provide as much as possible lock-free
	implementations of inter-thread messaging. <xref linkend="core-priority-inversion-table"/>
	lists the know uses of Orocos which <emphasis>might</emphasis> lead
	to priority inversion.

    <title>DataSources</title>
    <para>
      A <classname>RTT::DataSource</classname> is the fundamental
      data exchange entity within Orocos. It's interface is that of an
      'expression': it can be evaluate()'d, its result can be get() and
      an <classname>RTT::AssignableDataSource</classname> can
      even be set(). The <classname>RTT::DataObject</classname> types
      are implementations of DataSources, but many more kinds exists which
      are used by the Scripting engine and the task infrastructure.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <classname>RTT::DataSourceBase</classname> interface is the most
      basic interface for exchanging data ( value types ) between
      objects. They are reference counted ('smart pointers'), such
      that ownership across many objects must not be managed.
      The DataObjectInterface implements the DataSource interface,
      and thus all Orocos DataObject types are DataSources.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <classname>RTT::DataObjectInterface</classname> has multiple
      implementations, depending on the specific data access locking
      needs:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis role="strong"><classname>RTT::DataObject</classname></emphasis>. This is
	      the most simple DataObject implementation. The
	      <function>Get()</function> and
	      <function>Set()</function> methods directly map onto the
	      contents and can always be inlined by the compiler. It
	      offers no thread safety, but maximum efficiency for
	      copying data.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis role="strong"><classname>RTT::DataObjectLocked</classname></emphasis>.
	      This is a thread safe DataObject whose
	      <function>Set()</function> and
	      <function>Get()</function> methods are guarded by a
	      single mutex. The second thread accessing this object
	      will always block, which is not always appropriate in a
	      realtime system.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis
		role="strong"><classname>RTT::DataObjectPrioritySet</classname></emphasis>. This
	      is a more complex DataObject which gives always priority
	      to the thread calling <function>Set()</function>, which
	      will never block. The thread accessing
	      <function>Get()</function> will block if the
	      <function>Set()</function> thread is accessing the
	      contents. It is mainly used for sharing data between two
	      kernels, running at different priorities.
	    </para>
	    <note>
	      <para>
		This DataObject will only work if the
		<function>Set()</function> thread has the highest
		priority. When the inverse is true, data corruption
		will occur. It is obvious that this DataObject can
		only be used if both threads have static priorities
		(which is the case for all threads in the &orocos;
		framework).
	      </para>
	    </note>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis
		role="strong"><classname>RTT::DataObjectPriorityGet</classname></emphasis>. The
	      inverse of <function>DataObjectPrioritySet</function>.
	      The thread accessing <function>Get()</function> will
	      never block.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      <emphasis role="strong"><classname>RTT::DataObjectLockFree</classname></emphasis>.
	      This DataObject implements a non blocking reader/writer
	      buffer which always returns the last written value to
	      the reader. If the reader is preempted with a write and
	      a read, the last read will return a newer value, while
	      the first read continues to read the uncorrupted old
	      value.  The depth of this buffer must be readers+3, for
	      the algorithm to succeed in doing every write. Apart
	      from memory consumption, it is one of the best
	      thread-safe DataObject implementations.
